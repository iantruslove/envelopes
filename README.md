## Developer Notes
* Add node modules to package.json
* run `node-inspector` to debug node code in Chrome
* run `start_mongod` to start the DB
* run `NODE_ENV=development nodemon run.js` to run the app in nodemon, in dev mode

## TODO
* Nice file structure and layout to:
  * Separate all the client and server pieces
  * dev, test and prod mode runs that do logging, script concatenation and minification etc differently
  * A small number of root-level scripts to wrap everything and run the app etc
